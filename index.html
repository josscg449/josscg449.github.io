<h1>Casio Privia PX-560 Review</h1>
<p>I recently purchased this compeditively priced stage piano to replace my Yamaha DGX which 
is commonly known in the band as "The Beast". The Yamaha served me well, I've gigged it for 
7 years but at 46lbs I decided it was time to get something more light weight. Years ago, I 
would have never even dreamt of buying a Casio but I have to say this is a great stage piano 
for the money! Casio have come a long way in terms of quality and technology, while still 
remaining affordable. This Casio Privia PX-560 review is to show what this keyboard has to offer and 
to share my personal experience with it so far.

<h1>Hammond SK1 Organ Review</h1>
<p>I've been in rock bands as a keyboard player for a while. I used to just use different presets on my digital piano
to swap from piano to organ, but then I decided I wanted to get a second keyboard that would give me a better organ sound. 
Being that I'm in a classic rock band currently, I needed a better organ sound. So I bought a 2 tier stand and started 
researching the best digital organs on the market. It may not be the cheapest digital organ out there, but if you want 
a keyboard that can capture the classic organ sounds, the Hammond SK1 Organ is the way to go.
